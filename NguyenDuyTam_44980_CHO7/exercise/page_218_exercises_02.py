Problem:
What is object instantiation? What are the options at the programmer’s disposal
during this process?
Solution:
In computer science, instantiation is the realization of a predefined object. In OOP (object-oriented programming),
 a class of object may be defined. ... An instance of that object may then be declared, giving it a unique,
  named identity so that it may be used in the program

    ....
