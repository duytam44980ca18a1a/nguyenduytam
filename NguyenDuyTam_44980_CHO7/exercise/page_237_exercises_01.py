Problem:
1. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of lossless and lossy image filecompression schemes.
Solution:
Lossless compression results in a closer representation of the original media, and thus a higher quality end product.
The disadvantage is that the resulting file will be larger than if you had used a lossy compression format.
Lossy compression can give you a smaller file size, but the resulting end product may be in some ways inferior
 to the original.
