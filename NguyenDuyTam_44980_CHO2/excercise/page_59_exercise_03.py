Problem:
   Explain how to display a directory of all of the functions in a given module.
Solution:
In the case study, earlier in this chapter, we showed how to write documentation for a
Python script. To differentiate this script from the other modules in a program (and there
could be many), we call it the main module. Like any module, the main module can also
be imported. Instead of launching the script from a terminal prompt or loading it into the
shell from IDLE, you can start IDLE from the terminal prompt and import the script as a
module
