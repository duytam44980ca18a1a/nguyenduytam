Problem:
Anne complains that defining functions to use in her programs is a lot of extra work. She says she can finish her
 programs much more quickly if she just writes them using the basic operators and control statements.
  State three reasons why her view is shortsighted.
Solution:
1. Functions provide readability in the code (Readable Code)
 2. Functions avoid repetition in the code.
 3. Code can be broken down into sub-parts using functions. which is easy to understand by any new joiner.
 4. Function can be given a convenient name that describes its use in the program.
