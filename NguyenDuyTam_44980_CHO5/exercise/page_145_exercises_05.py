Problem:
 Assume that data refers to a list of numbers, and result refers to an empty list.
Write a loop that adds the nonzero values in data to the result list, keeping them
in their relative positions and excluding the zeros.
Solution:
"""
data = [7, 105, 0, 0, 9, 62]
result = ""
for number in data:
 if number != 0:
    result += str(number)
